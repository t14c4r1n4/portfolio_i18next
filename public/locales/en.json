    "intro": "<p>In 2022, after another temporary job, I decided that it was time for a change.</p><p>While traveling, I met a girl who worked as an online marketing manager, and it piqued my interest. I began a correspondence course to become a certified online marketing manager, which also included some HTML5 and CSS3 modules. I found myself fascinated by what I could create with these languages.</p><p>Then, I received an offer for a course as an Online Shop Developer with Python Basics. This marked my introduction to programming, and I discovered a passion for web development.</p><p>In my free time, I delved into Django, and later, JavaScript, React, and Vue. Currently, I favor React for its simple syntax and vibrant community.</p>"
